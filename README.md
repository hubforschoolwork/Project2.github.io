#This website is a very basic search engine to find gifs via an api from the Giphy website.

#User inputs a search term into the search field and clicks on the "go" button.

#Future Improvements Suggested:  1) Activate "sign-up" and "log-in" buttons, 2) increase number of items/gifs returned from search query, 3) change website background based on season or holiday, and 4) highlight a "Featured" gif of the day or week.
